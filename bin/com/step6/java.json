            "description": "The first edition of this daring book introduced a highly interactive, multi-sensory method for learning Java that enables new programmers and non-programmers alike to pick up the fundamentals of the Java language, so they can begin to design and write Java programs quickly. The approach has been so successful that we've released several other, more specialized Head First titles into the Java market. Head First Java teaches Java basics by engaging readers on many different levels; it stimulates their abilities in pattern matching and deduction, activates auditory pathways, as well as visual pathways and deeper thought. The book even provides alternative ways to experience the book-users can read a chapter start-to-finish, or simply skim the visual story of the chapter, and still learn! Because Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform, is a major update with many changes, the learning method in this book's new edition takes on even greater significance."
